## Was the world God created good?

Yes. God created the world and saw that it was very good. However, sin and evil corrupted God's good world through the agency of created beings, and human beings have participated in the project of evil ever sin.

## If the world was created good, why do we sin?

Adam and Eve, with the help of a created creature, rebelled against God and his vision of right and wrong. This began a project of sin and evil which lead to death, chaos, and destruction. I have inhereted this nature and often participate in the project of evil.
