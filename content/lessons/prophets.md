## What is a prophet?

A prophet is an individual called by God to enforce the covenant, call the people back to God, speak to the people on behalf of God, and occasionally, provide predictions about future events.

## What is different about the writing prophets from other prophets in Israel's history?

The writing prophets are those whose teachings were written down or compiled either by themselves or by their disciples. The three "major" prophets are distinct mainly in their length as well as by the fact that they all have a narrative in which the prophets are called by God.

## What was the message of Isaiah?

The message of Isaiah is divided in two halves, the first being written before the Babylonian exile and the second after.

In the first half, the message is about the coming destruction of Jerusalem, but with a hope of a seed which will bring about restoration and freedom from oppression.

The second half is a message of comfort. It tells the people of Israel returning home after decades of exile of a coming servant who will suffer but ultimately inherit God's kingdom and will open the gates to all the nations to become members of God's family.


## What do we learn about God from Isaiah's throneroom vision?

We learn that God does not live in or is contained by the Temple. He is so much more transcendent that even the train of his robe can barely be held by the bounds of the Holy of Holies.

([Isaiah 6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%206&version=NIV))

## What was the message of Jeremiah?

Jeremiah moves from accusation of infidelity to fulfillment of God's judgement on unfaithful Jerusalem. Despite the many calls of destruction and the ultimate consumation of that destruction, God has a promise of hope for his people that a king would come from the line of David.

## What does Jeremiah promise will happen to the hearts of people?

Jeremiah promises that when the Messiah comes, the covenant will be renewed the _torah_ will be written on the hearts of God's people.

## What was the message of Ezekiel?

Ezekiel primarily presents a two-fold vision of judgement and hope. On one hand, God will judge Israel for their covenant unfaithfulness as well the surrounding nations for their violence and pride. But on the other hand, God promises to restore Israel, defeat the evil among the nations, and create a new temple which will bring hope for all of creation.

## What do we learn from Ezekiel's throne visions?

From the Ezekiel's throne vision we learn that God is not bound by any place or worshippers and that idolatry is not tolerated among the people of God. But, despite the fact that he abandoned the central place of his worship, God remains with his people.
