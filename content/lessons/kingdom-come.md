Begin this lesson by first reading or reciting [the Lord's Prayer](/lords-prayer).

## What is the second petition of the Lord's prayer?

The second petition of the Lord's Prayer is: "Thy Kingdom Come."

## What do you mean by the Kingdom?

The kingdom of God is the just and peaceful reign of Jesus Christ over all the world, especially in the lives of his faithful people, through the power of the Holy Spirit. It is also the soon coming physical reign of Christ to be established at the end of all things.

## How has God's Kingdom already come?

God's kingdom has already come in the person of Jesus Christ and it advances through his Church.

## How has God's Kingdom not yet come?

God's kingdom has not yet come in the sense that we still anticipate the resurrection of the body, the life everlasting, the restoration of all things, the coming of the New Jerusalem, and the physical reign of Jesus here on earth.

## What are you asking when you pray for God's Kingdom to come?

When I pray for God's Kingdom to come, I am praying that the whole world would soon be renewed and restored and that its rightful Lord is installed as king. I am also praying that in whatever way possible, these ends would be advanced now, even ahead of his coming at the end of all things.

## How are you invited to live in God's Kingdom now?

I am invited to live in God's Kingdom now first through accepting the grace of salvation and of baptism, through the regular participation in the communion of the saints and the Lord's supper, through service to the vulnerable, and through prayer and worship.

## During what season do we specifically pray for Christ's return?

During the season of Advent, beginning four Sundays preceding Christmas, we pray specifically for Christ's return. During this we prepare our hearts to worship him in remembrance of his first coming at Christmas, but also to pray that he hasten his coming to set all things right.
