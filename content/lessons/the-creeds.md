## What is a creed?

Creed means "I believe." A creed is a statement which explains the faith as handed down over the lifetime of the Church.

## What is the purpose of the creeds?

The creeds exist to be unifying statements of faith which create the boundary for faithful belief in Christ Jesus and allow us to worship him fully.

## What does it mean to you to be allegient to Jesus?

It means that I am faithful to him as my only Lord and God. I reject the way in which empire seeks to draw my allegiance to worldly power achieved through death and violence.

## What creeds are useful for life in the Church?

There are three creeds which the unified Church has recognized as being useful for the life of the believer since the writing of each: the Apostle's Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed.

## What is the Apostle's Creed?
