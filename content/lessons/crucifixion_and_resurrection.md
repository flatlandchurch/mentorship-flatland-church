Begin this lesson by first reading the Apostle's Creed. See Resources section for text.

Note that the length of the Model requires the lines from "suffered under Pontius Pilate" through "he is coming again to judge the living and the dead" to be condensed into this lesson. Additional time may be spent beyond the questions provided to explore each of these lines in the Creed.

\question{Why did Jesus suffer?}

Jesus suffered to fulfill what was prophesied: "But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed."

\scripture{Isaiah 53}

\question{How do Jesus' sufferings help you?}

Through the suffering of Jesus I know that God has experienced the vast evils of this world. Jesus is truly able to sympathize with my weakness and pain. Therefore, I should bear my own sufferings with perseverence as I truly come to know Christ through suffering. 

\question{What happened at Jesus' crucifixion?}

At his crucifixion, Jesus was executed as a common criminal through a horrific, humiliating, and barbarous method. He was crushed under the weight of human evil and violent imagination, and on that cross, he died.

\scripture{Psalm 22; Isaiah 53; Matthew 26; 2 Corinthians 13}

\question{What did Jesus accomplish on the cross?}

Jesus fulfilled the Scriptures by suffering and dying on behalf of his people. Jesus offerred himself as a Passover lamb, a willing sacrifice, demonstrating the incredible love of God. On the cross Jesus disarmed the Devil, the evil powers, sin, and death.

\question{What do you mean Jesus rose from the dead?}

I mean that Jesus was really dead but God restored him physically to life in a resurrected body. The risen Jesus was seen by his disciples and by hundreds of other witnesses over the 40 days he remained on earth.

\scripture{Psalm 23}

\question{Why is it important that Jesus ascended into heaven?}

It is important because Jesus did not suffer death again. He died once and was raised to life once. He ascended bodily into heaven to be reunited with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

\scripture{Psalm 24}

\question{What does it mean that Jesus is seated at the right hand of the Father?}

The right hand is appointed to operate with the king's authority. So all authority is given to Jesus to judge the nations and rule over the world. As our great High Priest he intercedes on our behalf to the Father. Jesus' seating at the Father's right hand fulfills what the Psalms and Prophets said concerning the Messiah: that God would exalt him to his right hand.

\scripture{Psalm 110; Daniel 7; Mark 14:62; Acts 7:56}

\question{What do you mean when you say Jesus will come again?}

Jesus will come bodily to restore all creation and judge the Devil, sin, and evil once and for all. When Jesus returns all people will be resurrected, some to everlasting life and some to everlasting death.

\scripture{Daniel 12; 1 Corinthians 15}

\question{Can we know when Jesus will return?}

Jesus said that no one knows the day or hour of his return but the Father. As we anxiously anticipate that day, we pray, "Come quickly, Lord Jesus."

\scripture{Matthew 24:36; Revelation 22}
