## Who is the Holy Spirit?

The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity, coequal and coeternal with both God the Father and God the Son, and equally worthy of honor and worship.

## What are the ministries of the Holy Spirit?

The Holy Spirit gives life to all living things, reveals the word of God, and calls people to saving faith in Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit dwells within Christians, uniting them to Christ, convicting them of sin, granting spiritual gifts, and imparting grace.

## How do you receive the Holy Spirit?

All who repent and are baptized receive the Holy Spirit, who gives a new birth in Christ, breaks the hold of sin, and begins the work of sanctification.

([John 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203&version=NIV); [Acts 2:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:38&version=NIV); [1 Corinthians 6:9-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:9-11&version=NIV))

## How does the Holy Spirit strengthen you for life in Christ?

The Holy Spirit convicts me of sin, gives me spiritual gifts, extends graces, draws me closer to Christ, and reveals the Word of God to me.

The New Testament also mentions as gifts the specific roles of those who do Kingdom work: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors, and teachers.
