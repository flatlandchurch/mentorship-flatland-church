## What are the books contained in the Gospels?

Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

## What does the word "Gospel" mean?

Gospel means good news. In ancient times, the word Gospel was specifically connected with the innauguration of a new king or kingdom. When a city fell in battle and a new king was placed over that city, a messenger would run all over the country side shouting, "Good news! A new king has come."

## What is the Gospel which Jesus preached?

Jesus taught that the kingdom of heaven was at hand. God was about to enthrone his Messiah as king and begin the process of restoring creation.

## Are there more than one Gospel?

No, we have only one Gospel, but we do have four accounts of the same Gospel. They told in different words and from different perspectives, but they all give the same message.

## What is the basic story told in the Gospel accounts?

A man named Jesus was born to a virgin named Mary. Following his baptism by a prophet named John, he traveled throughout the countryside preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom. He surrounded himself with followers and chose twelve to be Apostles (meaning "those who are sent"). Throughout his ministry he healed all sorts of diseases, taught parables which described the nature of God's upside-down kingdom, and taught about the new type of life people in his kingdom would live.

Jesus' teaching came into conflict with the ruling powers of that day, so they plotted to arrest him and put him to death. During a sacred yearly festival of the Jews, Jesus instituted a special meal that both foretold and reminded his followers of his coming death. That same night, he was arrested and put on trial. The following afternoon, Jesus was executed in the most brutal form: Roman crucifixion.

Three days following his execution, Jesus was resurrected from the dead. He spent 40 days with his friends, teaching them about their mission and God's kingdom, and showing how all of Scripture pointed to and was fulfilled in Jesus. After 40 days with his friends, he ascended into heaven and was seated at the right hand of the Father.

## What do we learn about God in the Gospels?

Through the Gospels we discover that God is the primary and sole redemptive agent in all of human history. The promises of redemption, victory, and restoration were all wrapped up in himself. And now God reigns as king.
