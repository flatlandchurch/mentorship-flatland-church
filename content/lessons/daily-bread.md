Begin this lesson by first reading or reciting [the Lord's Prayer](/lords-prayer).

## What is the fourth petition of the Lord's prayer?

The fourth petition of the Lord's Prayer is: "give us this day our daily bread."

## What is meant by "our daily bread"?

Daily bread is all that we need to live, both physically and spiritually. This may be more than nourishment, but also clothing, shelter, and comfort as we have need.

## To what Old Testament image does the prayer for daily bread point?

The prayer for daily bread reminds us of God's provision for his people in the wilderness when he provided mana (flaky bread from heaven) for their needs daily. They had no need to sow or reap, nor were they to over consume, they were given precisely what they needed for nourishment.

## To what New Testament image does the prayer for daily bread point?

The prayer for daily bread reminds us of the Lord's supper, and ultimately, to Jesus Christ himself. Jesus described the bread of communion as his own body, which was broken for us. Spiritually we receive this sacrifice when we take communion, and are reminded of the ways in which God provides for us out of his abundance both physically and spiritually.

## Why do we only now pray for our daily bread?

In praying for our daily bread only after praying for God's glory, kingdom, and will, we are reminded that it is God who provides for all our needs, not we ourselves.

## Why does God provide our daily bread?

God gives me daily bread because he is a good and loving Father, who gives good things to all his children, sustains us in life, and desires that we grow daily in his grace.

## How do we join with those who do not have their daily fill in prayer?

When we petition God for our daily bread we do not ask only for ourselves. We pray "give _us_ this day," not "give me this day." And so we join in agreement for those who are hungry that God would provide for them, especially those of us who already have food handy in our cupboards.
