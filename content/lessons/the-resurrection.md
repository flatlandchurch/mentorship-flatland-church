Begin this lesson by first reading the Apostle's Creed. See Resources section for text.

## What does Holy Scripture teach you about your body?

Holy Scripture teaches me that my body was created good, but was tainted by sin by the first humans. As a human, I bear the image of God and every other human is endowed with the same value and dignity. Therefore, all human life from conception through death is worthy of care, protection, and love.

([Genesis 1:26-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:26-28&version=NIV); [Psalm 139](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20139&version=NIV); [Matthew 11:2-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2011:2-5&version=NIV); [1 Corinthians 6:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:19-20&version=NIV))

## Why will you die?

I will die because our human ancestors rebelled against God and chose the way that leads to death. As a result, sin and death now corrupt my mortal body, leading to degeneration and ultimately death. When I die, my soul will be somehow with Christ, and in the end, I will be raised bodily when Jesus returns to judge the living and the dead.

([Genesis 3:22-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:22-24&version=NIV); [Psalm 82](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2082&version=NIV); [John 6:35-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:35-40&version=NIV); [Romans 5:12-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:12-14&version=NIV))

## What is the resurrection of the body?

When Jesus returns to restore heaven and earth and judge the living and the dead, I will be raised bodily from the dead, receiving a renewed, resurrected body. The wicked will receive eternal condemnation and the righteous eternal life with God.

([Daniel 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2012&version=NIV); [Psalm 16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2016&version=NIV); [Matthew 25:31-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025:31-46&version=NIV); [Revelation 20:11-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2020:11-15&version=NIV))

## How should you live as you await the resurrection of the body?

Because I know that all things in heaven and on earth will be renewed, including my body, I should honor and care for my own body as well as the earthly things I am entrusted with. I should also seek to defend myself and others from those things which cause violence, abuse, or degredation.

([Psalm 35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2035&version=NIV); [1 Corinthians 6:9-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:9-20&version=NIV))

## What do you know about the unending resurrected life of believers?

They will be fully renewed and glorified in the image of Jesus, perfected after the manner of his own resurrected and ascended body.

([1 Corinthians 15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015&version=NIV); [Revelation 21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021&version=NIV))
