Begin this lesson by first reading or reciting [the Lord's Prayer](/lords-prayer).

## What is the first petition of the Lord's prayer?

The first petition of the Lord's Prayer is "hallowed be thy name."

## What is God's Name?

God's Name as revealed in Scripture is YHWH. The Name means I AM WHO I AM, indicating that God is self-existing, that he alone is truly God, and that there is no other who is like him.

## Why do we refer to God as Lord?

Lord has two particular meanings. In the first it was used as a sign of reverence without using God's personal Name (YHWH), so as to not accidentally blaspheme his Name. In the Hebrew Bible you will often encounter Lord as YHWH.

Lord in the New Testament often refers specifically to Jesus. In this way we proclaim him as not only the second person of the Trinity (and therefore YHWH himself), but also that he is king (or Lord) over the whole world.

## How does God hallow his name?

God's Name is holy in itself. God glorifies his Name by redeeming fallen humanity, by building his Church, by establishing his kingdom in this world and in the age to come, and by placing his Name in Jesus.

## How can you hallow God's Name?

I can honor God's Name as holy by worshipping him alone, by serving others, and by living in obedience to his teaching as a child and citizen of his kingdom.
