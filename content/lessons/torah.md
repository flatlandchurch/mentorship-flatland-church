## Why do you call it the Torah?

_Torah_ is a Hebrew word which has no precise English translation. The most appropriate is probably teaching, though historically it has been translated as Law. Sometimes we call this collection the Pentateuch, a Greek word meaning five books.

## What is contained in the Torah?

The five books attributed to Moses are contained in the Torah: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

## What has the Church said about the Torah in the life of the Christian?

The Church has said that all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the people of God may be perfect, equipped for all good works. Furthermore, it has affirmed that for the Gentile believers (anyone who is not a Jew), we need not be bound by the individual tenets of the covenant made on Mount Sinai in order to be members of the family of God.

## Is the Torah still useful to us today?

The Torah is still useful to us today in instruction and in wisdom and for undestanding the character of God. The covenant obligations are not binding on the Christian believer, but nevertheless provide great wisdom and a window into the heart of God.

## What did Israel do to merit God's salvation?

Israel did nothing to merit God's salvation from Egypt. God honored his covenant to Abraham, a covenant he entered into of his own volition, by rescuing the nation of Israel out of the bondage of Egypt through mighty works.

## How was Israel saved of their sins?

Absolution of Israel's sins were primarily accounted for yearly on the Day of Atonement with the sacrifice of a bull by the High Priest. The High Priest would stand in the role of the \yhwh and bless the people in this manner. Various other offenses, both moral and covenantal, were similarly absolved through more immediate sacrifices handled by the Levitical priests.

## What is the greatest commandment?

The greatest commandment which the Torah teaches and Jesus affirms is to love the \yhwh your God with all of your heart, soul, and strength. The second commandment is similar to the first: love your neighbor as yourself.

([Deuteronomy 6:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206:4-5&version=NIV); [Leviticus 19:18b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2019:18b&version=NIV); [Matthew 22:36-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022:36-40&version=NIV); [Psalm 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%201&version=NIV))

## What does God reveal about himself in the Torah?

God reveals that his name is YHWH. He reveals that he is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loyal love and faithfulness. He maintains his love to thousands, he forgives wrong doing, trangression, and wrong-doing. But he does not leave the guilty unpunished, inflicting punishment on the fathers on the children to the third even the fourth generation.

([Exodus 34:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2034:6-7&version=NIV))

## Why should we read the Torah?

In the Torah we learn intimately the character of God as creator, redeemer, and restorer. We also learn of his wise teaching to his covenant nation, and see his faithfulness demonstrated time and again. In meditating on the words of the Torah regularly we are blessed.

([Psalm 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%201&version=NIV))
