## What is an ordinance?

An ordinance is a command of Jesus meant to memorialize his life, death, resurrection, and continued presence in our lives.

## What were the two ordinances ordained by Christ?

While on earth Jesus prescribed two ordinances: baptism and communion.

([Mark 14:22-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014:22-25&version=NIV); [Matthew 28:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:19&version=NIV); [1 Corinthians 11:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:26&version=NIV))

## What is the outward and visible sign of baptism?

The outward and visible sign of baptism is the immersion of the person in water and the raising of the person back out of the water, preceded by the phrase, "I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."

([Matthew 28:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:19&version=NIV))

## What is the inward and spiritual grace of baptism?

The inward and spiritual grace of baptism is the death to sin and renewal of life in the Spirit. In baptism we are united to Christ in his death and resurrection. Through baptism I become a member of Christ's body and adopted into God's family.

([Acts 2:38-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:38-41&version=NIV); [1 Corinthians 12:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012:13&version=NIV); [Titus 3:3-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%203:3-7&version=NIV))

## What is required of you when you come to baptism?

Two things are required of me: repentance and faith. I repent of my sin, which means to turn away from it and move in the opposite direction. I place my faith in Jesus Christ as my Savior and Lord, trusting in the promises of God given in this ordinance.

([Acts 2:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:38&version=NIV); [Romans 10:9-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:9-13&version=NIV))

## Should you ever become rebaptized?

All Christians who have been properly baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit should not seek rebaptism. Rather I should remember the promises made by God in my baptism and seek to live a Christ-centered life.

## What is the outward and visible sign of communion?

The outward and visible sign of communion is the bread or wafer and the juice, which Christ commands us to receive.

## What is the inward and spiritual grace of communion?

The inward gift signified is the Body and Blood of Christ, which are spiritually taken and received in the Lordâ€™s Supper by faith.

([1 Corinthians 11:24-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:24-26&version=NIV))

## Who may receive communion?

All baptized Christians who have repented of their sins and have professed a faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.

([Matthew 18:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018:20&version=NIV); [1 Corinthians 11:27-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:27-29&version=NIV))

## What is required of your when you come to communion?

I am to examine myself for any unrepentent sins, ensure I hold no strife with any brother or sister, and enter into communion with a truly thankful heart.

([Matthew 5:23-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:23-24&version=NIV); [1 Corinthians 11:27-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:27-29&version=NIV))
