## What is the seventh petition of the Lord's prayer?

The seventh and final petition of the Lord's Prayer is: "deliver us from evil."

## What is evil?

Evil is the willful rejection and work against God's good will. Evil defies God's holiness, denies the dignity of humanity, perverts God's teaching, enslaves humanity to sin, and corrupts and harms all creation.

## Why does God permit evil?

God permits the activity of evil for a time so that the good may not be destroyed with the evil until it is mature. Though God did not create evil, his good creation has turned sour by participating in a project of evil which attempts to thwart his will and bring violence, destruction, and death.

## What is the Devil?

The Devil is the accuser and adversary of all humanity. It is a created being in rebellion against God from the beginning of creation until the end. At the end of all things it will be destroyed along with sin and death.

## What are demons and the forces of evil?

Like the Devil, demons are created beings who are now in rebellion and open opposition to God. They now cause spiritual and sometimes physical harm to human beings, and they sow lies that lead to confusion, despair, sin, and death.

## What are angels?

Angels are rational, spiritual beings created by God. Godâ€™s holy angels joyfully serve him in heavenly worship, and God appoints them to act as messengers, bringing words of guidance and assurance to the faithful, and assisting and protecting them.

## What is the ultimate weapon of evil?

The ultimate weapon of evil is the sword: the ability to extinguish life as a demonstration of power and force.

## How did Jesus triumph over evil?

Jesus triumphs over evil by showing that the ultimate weapon of evil is powerless in light of God's power of life and resurrection. In his death, resurrection, and ascencion, Jesus shows that death has no power over the people of God.

## How does God deliver you from evil?

Jesus has conquered the dominion of darkness and now grants me 
victory over sin and evil through the Holy Spirit. He transforms my mind and heart to see and oppose evil, and gives me the power to overcome it. He gives me strength to endure my trials gracefully and may even remove them from me. Should I ever suffer martyrdom, I do not have to fear as the weapons of the enemy are meaningless in light of the resurrection.
