## What is the sixth petition of the Lord's prayer?

The sixth petition of the Lord's Prayer is: "lead us not into temptation."

## What is temptation?

Temptation is any enticement to turn from God's instruction, follow your own definition of right and wrong, and so participate in the project of evil.

## What causes temptation?

I am tempted by false promises of the world, the selfish desires of my own flesh, and the lies of the devil. All of these things are at war against God and his good will.

## Should you say that God is tempting you?

We should never say that God is tempting us nor do we say that he is the cause for sin. He will allow me to be tested however, so I may grow in obedience and faith to him.

## How can you defend against temptation?

I may avoid temptation by praying for protection and strength to withstand, by confessing my sins to God and fellow Christians, by meditating on God's word, by avoiding situations which may stir temptation, and by surrounding myself with the community of believers.

## How can the Church help you defend against temptation?

In the fellowship of Christâ€™s Body, I can find companionship, support to resist ungodly influence, wisdom to guard me, teaching to grow in holiness, and discipline to correct me when I fall into error.
