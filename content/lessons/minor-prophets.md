## Why do you call them the Minor Prophets?

In the Protestant canon we refer to them as Minor Prophets because they are a collection of shorter prophetic books than Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. In the Hebrew canon, they are often simply referred to as "The Twelve."

## What books are contained in the Minor Prophets?

Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habbakuk, Zephaniah, Obadiah, Haggai, Zachariah, and Malachi.

## What do the prophets collectively say is the reason for Israel's destruction?

Israel is destroyed for their idolatry, for ignoring the covenant, and for their injustice to their own people, especially the widows, orphans, poor, and aliens.

## How do the prophets still speak to us?

Through the prophets we witness God's heart for all people, not only his heart for the vulnerable, but his condemnation of wickedness, violence, and empire. The prophets teach us to develop an imagination formed in God's teaching and not in the patterns of the surrounding culture.

## What is shalom?

_Shalom_ is Hebrew word which means the peace that comes from everything being in its proper order.

## How does God's righteousness and justice bring about shalom?

When God demonstrates righteousness, the vulnerable are fed, clothed, and sheltered. When God judges the wicked, the project of evil is undone and wholeness is restored.
