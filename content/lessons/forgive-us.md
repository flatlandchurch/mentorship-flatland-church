Begin this lesson by first reading or reciting [the Lord's Prayer](/lords-prayer).

## What is the fifth petition of the Lord's prayer?

The fifth petition of the Lord's Prayer is: "forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."

## What does it mean to trespass?

A trespass is a wrong done to someone. We often call these wrongs sins, especially when, in thought, word, or deed, we offend God's holy character and violate his teaching. Many of the sins we commit also cause injury to our fellow humans, and so are doubly harmful.

## How do you sin against God's teaching?

I sin against God's teaching when I choose my own selfish will over the will of God, when I place myself above others, and participate in projects of evil.

## What is God's forgiveness?

God's forgiveness is his merciful pardon of the sins and offenses we have committed toward him. Any guilt laid on us by our own disobedience is removed by God's grace.

## How do we seek God's forgiveness?

I ask God our loving Father to forgive me through his Son, Jesus Christ, who bore my sins upon the Cross, so that through faith and Baptism I can receive his righteousness.

## Why should we forgive others?

I should forgive other because while I was still a sinner, God forgave me through Jesus Christ. Failing to forgive denies God's own forgiveness extended to me and provides a foothold for more evil to abound.

## Will forgiving others always lead to reconciliation and restoration?

No, forgiving others may not always lead to reconciliation and restoration, but in the forgiving we extend God's own healing grace to those who have harmed us. Despite this, I am still called to forgive.
