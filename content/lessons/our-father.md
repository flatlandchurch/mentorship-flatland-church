Begin this lesson by first reading or reciting [the Lord's Prayer](/lords-prayer).

## What is the preface of the Lord's Prayer?

The Lord's Prayer begins: "Our Father, who art in heaven."

## Why do we call God "Father"?

We call God our Father because Jesus taught his disciples to call God Father and that we are God's children.

## Why did Jesus teach us to pray "our" Father?

Jesus teaches us to view ourselves as members of a community and great big family, not merely as individuals. We pray what we believe to be true about our relationship to God.

## What does it mean for us to approach God with a child-like demeanor?

It means that we approach God with humility, never believing ourselves greater than he. We submit to his wisdom, like children trusting a parent for things they do not yet understand.

## How is God like an earthly father?

Like all loving and sincere earthly fathers, God loves us in our weakness, provides for our needs, teaches us in our ignorance, and corrects us when we go astray.

## How is God unlike an earthly father?

Unlike our earthly fathers, our heavenly Father loves us perfectly, is capable to care for us in all things, makes no errors in judgment, and disciplines us only for our good.

## What is heaven?

Heaven is the place where God dwells. It is the place of his presence, power, and glory and it exists alongside, though separate, from all things visible. From heaven God hears the prayers of his children.
